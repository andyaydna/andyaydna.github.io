        <p>Hi! My name is Andy. I was born in Hong Kong in 1995 but in 2002, my family decided to move to Canada. 
            After high school, I started University at the University of British Columbia (UBC). In 2018, I graduated with a Bachelor of Management degree. 
            After working a year, I decided to pursue further education but this time in the field of technology. So, in September of 2019, I started the Computer Information Technology (CIT) program at BCIT. 
            Other than that, my hobbies include sports, movies, tech, travelling, and photography.</p>
